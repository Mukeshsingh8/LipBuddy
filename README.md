# LipBuddy
LipBuddy is a full-stack application built upon the LipNet deep learning model. It processes video inputs to perform lip-reading and predict spoken words based on visual inputs. The project integrates video processing, model predictions, and a user-friendly interface to visualize the input, intermediate results, and final predictions.
